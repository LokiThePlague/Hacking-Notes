In the context of Linux, *groups* are used to *organize* users and *assign permissions* to access system resources. Users can belong to one or more groups, and groups can have different levels of permissions to access system resources.

There are special groups in Linux, such as '*lxd*' or '*docker*', which are used to allow users to run containers securely and efficiently. However, if a malicious user has access to one of these groups, they could exploit it to gain elevated privileges on the system.

For example, if a user has access to the '*docker*' group, they could use the Docker tool to deploy new containers to the system. During the deployment process, the user could take advantage of *mounts* to make certain resources inaccessible on the host machine available in the container. By gaining access to the container as the '*root*' user, the malicious user could infer or manipulate the contents of these resources from the container.

To mitigate the risk of abuse of special user groups, it is important to carefully limit access to these groups and ensure that they are only assigned to trusted users who really need access to them.
