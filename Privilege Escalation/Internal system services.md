*Internal services* are essential components that operate in the background within an operating system, taking care of critical functions such as network management, printing, software updates and system monitoring, among others.

However, if these services are *not properly configured* and active, they can represent a significant security breach. Attackers could exploit these services to gain unauthorized access to the system and carry out malicious activities.

A concrete example would be a misconfigured network service with elevated permissions. If an attacker manages to identify it and find a way to exploit it, they could use it to escalate privileges and gain administrator access.
