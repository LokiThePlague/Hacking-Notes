Session Puzzling, Session Fixation and Session Variable Overloading are different names for security vulnerabilities that affect *session management* in a web application.

The *Session Fixation* vulnerability occurs when an attacker sets a valid session ID for a user and then waits for the user to log in. If the user logs in with that session identifier, the attacker could access the user's session and perform malicious actions on the user's behalf. To accomplish this, the attacker can trick the user into clicking on a link that includes a valid session ID or exploit a weakness in the web application to establish the session ID.

The term "*Session Puzzling*" is sometimes used to refer to the same vulnerability, but from the point of view of the attacker attempting to *guess* or *generate valid session identifiers*.

Finally, the term "*Session Variable Overloading*" refers to a specific type of Session Fixation attack in which the attacker sends a large amount of data to the web application with the goal of overloading session variables. If the web application does not properly validate the amount of data that can be stored in the session variables, the attacker could overload them with malicious data and cause application performance problems.

To prevent these vulnerabilities, it is important to use random and secure session identifiers, validate user authentication and authorization before establishing a session, and limit the amount of data that can be stored in session variables.
