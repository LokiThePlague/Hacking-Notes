**Race conditions** are a type of vulnerability that can occur in computer systems where two or more processes or threads compete for the same resources without an adequate synchronization mechanism to control access to them.

This means that if two processes attempt to access the same shared resource at the same time, the output of one or both processes may be unpredictable, or even result in undesired system behavior.

Attackers can take advantage of race conditions to carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, overwrite critical data, gain unauthorized access to resources, or even execute malicious code on the system.

For example, suppose two processes try to access a file at the same time: one to read and the other to write. If there is no proper mechanism to synchronize access to the file, it may happen that the reading process reads incorrect data from the file, or that the writing process overwrites important data that needs to be preserved.

The impact of race conditions on security depends on the nature of the shared resource and the type of attack that can be carried out. In general, race conditions can allow attackers to access critical resources, modify important data, or even take complete control of the system. Therefore, it is important that developers and system administrators take steps to prevent and mitigate race conditions on their systems.
